Text-to-Speech
Text-to-Speech generation using API. It's built on the latest research, was designed to achieve the best audio with control for voice, pitch, and speed. TTS comes with pretrained models, tools for measuring dataset quality and will be linked to wikipedia API.

Text to speech (TTS) is a form of speech synthesis that converts text on a page into spoken voice output. This app can be used for things such as reading large pdf files, wikipedia articles and reading information for visually impaired. It can be configured to change in speed, pitch, voice, and language. These type of ultility tools I believe are the key to improving function, learning, and quality of life. I personally use this daily and learn something everyday from wikipedia.
